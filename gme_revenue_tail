Question 4: Use Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

#Use the requests library to download the webpage https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/stock.html. Save the text of the response as a variable named html_data.

url = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/stock.html"

#import requests

response = requests.get (url)
if response.status_code == 200:
html_data = response.text
print ("Webpage downloaded successfully.")
else:
print("Failed to download webpage. Status code:", response.status_code)

#Parse the HTML data using beautiful_soup

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_data, 'html.parser')

#Using BeautifulSoup or the read_html function extract the table with GameStop Revenue and store it into a dataframe named gme_revenue. The dataframe should have columns Date and Revenue. Make sure the comma and dollar sign is removed from the Revenue column using a method similar to what you did in Question 2.

tables = pd.read_html(html_data)
gme_revenue = tables [0]
gme_revenue.columns = ['Date', 'Revenue']
gme_revenue ['Revenue'] = gme_revenue ['Revenue']. str. replace(',,', "').str. replace('$$', "')

#Display the last five rows of the gme_revenue dataframe using the tail function. Take a screenshot of the results.

print(gme_revenue.tail(5))
